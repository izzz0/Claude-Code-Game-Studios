# Technical Preferences

<!-- project.yaml at the repo root is the machine-readable source of truth for
     engine, specialists, naming, performance, platform, and testing.framework.
     This file is the human-readable LEGACY FALLBACK: agents and skills resolve
     each key from project.yaml first and fall back here only when the
     project.yaml key is absent. Codex setup writes project.yaml; existing
     legacy values remain fallbacks until explicitly replaced.
     Forbidden patterns and allowed libraries are NOT migrated — they live only
     in this file. Populated by $ccgs-setup-engine; updated as decisions are made. -->

## Forbidden Patterns

<!-- Add patterns that should never appear in this project's codebase -->
- [None configured yet — add as architectural decisions are made]

## Allowed Libraries / Addons

<!-- Add approved third-party dependencies here -->
- [None configured yet — add as dependencies are approved]

## Architecture Decisions Log

<!-- Quick reference linking to full ADRs in docs/architecture/ -->
- [No ADRs yet — use an accepted project decision to create one]
