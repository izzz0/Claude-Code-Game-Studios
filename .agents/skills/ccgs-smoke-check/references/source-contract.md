# Smoke Check

This skill is the gate between "implementation done" and "ready for QA
hand-off". It runs the automated test suite, checks for test coverage gaps,
batch-verifies critical paths with the developer, and produces a PASS/FAIL
report.

The rule is simple: **a build that fails smoke check does not go to QA.**
Handing a broken build to QA wastes their time and demoralises the team.

**Output:** `production/qa/smoke-[date].md`

Every `the caller's input channel` call follows `.agents/studio/docs/automation-modes.md`
(collaborative reviews major drafts · guided raises material decisions · autonomous records decisions;
`automation_always_ask` categories always prompt).

**`qa.level`**: at `minimal`, smoke-check is **optional** — an unconfigured test suite may be explicitly waived when no stricter story requirement exists, but a configured suite that runs and FAILs still blocks hand-off, and a project with no game
tests is checked by its build, launch and critical paths alone (Phase 1 step 1); at `standard`, it is required
before a phase transition; at `full`, before every commit. This sits in front of
the Phase 6 `testing.strict.config` resolution (which only matters once a smoke run
gates). Distinct axis from `workflow`.

## Parse Arguments

Arguments can be combined: `$ccgs-smoke-check sprint --platform console`

**Base mode** (first argument, default: `sprint`):
- `sprint` — full smoke check against the current sprint's stories
- `quick` — skip coverage scan (Phase 3) and Batch 3; use for rapid re-checks

**Platform flag** (`--platform`, default: none):
- `--platform pc` — add PC-specific checks (keyboard, mouse, windowed mode)
- `--platform console` — add console-specific checks (gamepad, TV safe zones,
  platform certification requirements)
- `--platform mobile` — add mobile-specific checks (touch, portrait/landscape,
  battery/thermal behaviour)
- `--platform all` — add all platform variants; output per-platform verdict table

If `--platform` is provided, Phase 4 adds platform-specific batches and
Phase 5 outputs a per-platform verdict table in addition to the overall verdict.

## Phase 2: Run Automated Tests

**Read `references/2-run-tests.md` now and follow it** — this phase's steps are in that file, not here. Read it again if the conversation was compacted or resumed during this phase.

## Phase 3: Check Test Coverage

**Read `references/3-coverage.md` now and follow it** — this phase's steps are in that file, not here. Read it again if the conversation was compacted or resumed during this phase.

## Phase 4: Run Manual Smoke Checks

**Read `references/4-manual-checks.md` now and follow it** — this phase's steps are in that file, not here. Read it again if the conversation was compacted or resumed during this phase.

## Phase 5: Generate Report

**Read `references/5-report.md` now and follow it** — this phase's steps are in that file, not here. Read it again if the conversation was compacted or resumed during this phase.

## Phase 6: Write and Gate

**Read `references/6-write-gate.md` now and follow it** — this phase's steps are in that file, not here. Read it again if the conversation was compacted or resumed during this phase.

## Collaborative Protocol

**Applies in `collaborative` mode (the default).** For `guided` and
`autonomous` modes, see `.agents/studio/docs/automation-modes.md` — the rules below
describe what collaborative mode requires, not universal behavior.

- **Never treat NOT RUN as automatic FAIL** — record it as NOT RUN and let
  the developer confirm status manually. Unconfirmed NOT RUN yields **NOT
  ASSESSED**, not FAIL — and not a pass verdict either.
- **Never auto-fix failures** — report them and state what must be resolved.
  Do not attempt to edit source code or test files.
- **PASS WITH WARNINGS does not erase blockers** — it records advisory gaps for
  `$ccgs-story-done` to follow up on; any FAIL or NOT ASSESSED result still holds
  hand-off.
- **`quick` argument** skips Phase 3 (coverage scan) and Phase 4 Batch 3.
  Use it for rapid re-checks after fixing a specific failure.
- Use `the caller's input channel` for all manual smoke check verification.
- **Write the report within the accepted scope** — ordinary authorized report
  writes do not require a separate approval prompt for each file.
