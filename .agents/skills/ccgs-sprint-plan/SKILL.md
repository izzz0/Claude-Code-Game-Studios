# Sprint Plan


## Existing Sprints

Run `bash .agents/studio/hooks/yaml-helper.sh resolve_config --keys rigor,automation,workflow` and use its output.

Resolved before this skill runs — use it to identify the previous sprint in
Phase 1 rather than re-globbing.

---

## Phase 0: Parse Arguments

Extract the mode argument (`new`, `update`, or `status`).

See `.agents/studio/docs/director-gates.md` for the full check pattern. Individual gate definitions live in `.agents/studio/docs/director-gates/[gate-id].md` — the spawned agent reads its own gate file; do not read it in the parent session.


Every
`native user-input mechanism` call follows `.agents/studio/docs/automation-modes.md`
(collaborative reviews major drafts · guided raises material decisions · autonomous records decisions;
`automation_always_ask` categories always prompt).

**`story_granularity`** — it sets how
many stories to allocate per sprint, scaled by velocity: **2–4** at `coarse` (the default, via `rigor: minimal`),
**6–10** at `balanced` (`rigor: standard`), **15–25** at `fine`. A Ready backlog
smaller than the range is planned whole — never padded with invented stories.

**Review mode check** (before gates run):
- Use the review mode from the resolved block above (`--review` overrides it
  for this run) — do not re-resolve it, and do not ask for it. With nothing
  configured it follows `modes.rigor`: `solo` at `minimal`, `lean` at `standard`.
- **Never write a review mode** — not to `project.yaml`, not to
  `production/review-mode.txt`. `modes.review_mode` is one of the knobs
  `modes.rigor` fronts: pinning it in `project.yaml` shadows the rigor
  expansion, and the legacy file sits *above* that expansion, so either write
  would freeze director-review depth for good. `--review` covers a one-off. If
  the user wants a different depth to persist, point them to changing
  `modes.rigor` (`$ccgs-settings modes.rigor=<minimal|standard|full>`), or to pinning
  it on purpose with `$ccgs-settings --local modes.review_mode=<full|lean|solo>` (a
  personal override in `project.local.yaml`).

---

## Phase 1: Gather Context

1. **Read the current milestone** from `production/milestones/` **if it exists**.
   No skill writes this directory — it is authored by hand from
   `.agents/studio/docs/templates/milestone-definition.md`. On the majority of projects
   it is absent, which is the normal state, not a gap: note "no milestone
   defined — planning against the story backlog alone" and continue. Never block
   sprint planning on it, and never infer a milestone from the sprint files.

2. **Read the previous sprint** (if any) from `production/sprints/` to
 understand velocity and carryover. In `new` mode:
   - The new sprint's number `[N]` is the highest `sprint-NNN.md` in the
     Existing Sprints listing plus one (`001` when there is none). It is the
   - The `[N]` in the plan's title and its QA plan path.
   - Every story of the previous sprint that is not `Complete` — by its status
     in `production/sprint-status.yaml`, else its story file's Status line —
     goes in the Carryover table with a Reason and a New Estimate. It appears
     only there, never again as new Must Have / Should Have / Nice to Have work.

3. **Find the stories to plan** — this is the actual backlog, and it is the one
   input this phase cannot do without:
   ```
   Glob production/epics/**/story-*.md
   Grep pattern="^> \*\*Status\*\*" glob="production/epics/**/story-*.md" output_mode="content"
   ```
   Stories live at `production/epics/[epic-slug]/story-NNN-[slug].md` — that is
   where `$ccgs-create-stories` writes them and where `$ccgs-dev-story` looks for them. Plan
   from the ones marked `Ready`. Use the grep rather than reading each story: at
   this stage you need status and title, not the body.

   If the glob returns nothing: "No stories found under `production/epics/`. Run
   `$ccgs-create-stories` first (at `standard`/`full`, `$ccgs-create-epics` before it)."
   Do not proceed to invent work items — a sprint plan that references stories
   which do not exist cannot be implemented. Verdict: **BLOCKED** — no stories to plan.

4. **Scan design documents** in `design/gdd/` for additional context on the
   features those stories implement. Read each by section: find the headings you
   need with the Grep tool (pattern `^#`, content mode) and Read those ranges
   with offset and limit. At `workflow: minimal` there are no
   per-system GDDs — use `design/game-brief.md` instead, and do not treat the
   absent GDDs as missing work. (Note: `$ccgs-sprint-plan` is **optional** at
   `minimal` — the brief's Build order already is the plan.)

5. **Check the risk register** at `production/risk-register/` **if it exists**.
   Like the milestone above, no skill writes it — entries are authored by hand
   from `.agents/studio/docs/templates/risk-register-entry.md`. If the directory is
   absent, say so once ("no risk register — risks assessed from the sprint
   contents only") rather than skipping risk assessment silently.

---

## Phase 2: Generate Output

For `new`:

**Generate a sprint plan** following this format and present it to the user. The
gate phases run first and may require revisions: the ccgs-producer feasibility
gate (Phase 4, spawned only in `full` review mode — skipped in `lean`/`solo`)
and the QA plan check (Phase 5, all modes).

```

### Check the goal's prerequisites

Before you present a `new` plan, check that its goal can be shown working by the
sprint's end. A goal can need something no story builds: a playtest needs a
scene to run in. This check reports and never blocks. It adds no question and no
story of its own.

1. **Settle the goal.** Quote the milestone's goal when there is one; otherwise
   write one sentence from the stories picked.
2. **List what showing it needs.** A goal the player can see or play (a playable
   loop, a feature working end to end, a playtest) needs the scene or level it
   runs in and the setting that starts it: `run/main_scene` in `project.godot`,
   the scene list in Unity's `ProjectSettings/EditorBuildSettings.asset`, or
   `GameDefaultMap` in Unreal's `Config/DefaultEngine.ini`. Add any file, scene
   or system that a picked story's acceptance criteria, notes or dependencies
   name and no picked story creates. A goal with nothing to run or show (logic
   and tests only) needs none.
3. **Check each one.** It is covered when it exists in the project or a picked
   story builds it. Find scenes by the engine's scene files (`engine.name` in
   `project.yaml`): `*.tscn` for Godot, `Assets/**/*.unity` for Unity,
   `Content/**/*.umap` for Unreal. Find anything else by the path or name the
   stories use. With no engine set, check by name only and say the scene search
   did not run.
4. **Fill in the Goal Prerequisites section**: each need with `exists`,
   `built by [story ID]` or **missing**, or the single row "None: the goal has
   nothing to run or show". Copy each missing one into Risks. When you present
   the plan, name each missing one and the three fixes open to the user: pull in
   the Ready story that builds it (name it, and say if that takes the sprint past
   its `story_granularity` range or needs stories it depends on), write a story
   for it first with `$ccgs-create-stories`, or reword the goal to promise only what
   the sprint can show. Give them as part of the plan,
   not as a question: report the gap and let the user choose a consequential
   scope/product fix. **Report the gap; do not solve it.** A
   missing prerequisite stays missing in this plan, however small it looks (a
   flat test level, an input map): plan no task for it and put none of its work
   into a picked story, not even as setup. Its work needs a story first, which
   is `$ccgs-create-stories`' job. Never add a story the backlog does not
   hold, and never widen a picked story or edit a story file to cover the gap.

For `update`:

**Update an existing sprint plan**:

1. Read the most recent sprint plan from `production/sprints/`.
2. Present the current story list with their current statuses from `production/sprint-status.yaml`.
3. Ask the user what to change: stories to add, remove, reprioritize, or re-estimate. Use
`native user-input mechanism` to gather changes.
4. Apply the changes and re-present the full revised plan for review. If the
   goal or the Must Have stories changed, check the goal's prerequisites again first.
5. Re-run the ccgs-producer feasibility gate (Phase 4) on the revised plan.
6. Return the updated markdown plan and yaml drafts; do not write files.

Note: `update` mode does not reset story statuses. Stories already marked `in-progress` or `done` keep their status. Only `backlog` and `ready-for-dev` stories can be removed or reprioritized freely.

For `status`:

**Generate a status report**:

```markdown
# Sprint [N] Status -- [Date]

## Progress: [X/Y tasks complete] ([Z%])

### Completed
| Task | Completed By | Notes |
|------|-------------|-------|

### In Progress
| Task | Owner | % Done | Blockers |
|------|-------|--------|----------|

### Not Started
| Task | Owner | At Risk? | Notes |
|------|-------|----------|-------|

### Blocked
| Task | Blocker | Owner of Blocker | ETA |
|------|---------|-----------------|-----|

## Burndown Assessment
[On track / Behind / Ahead]
[If behind: What is being cut or deferred]

## Emerging Risks
- [Any new risks identified this sprint]
```

---

## Phase 3: Prepare Sprint Status File

After generating a new sprint plan, also prepare the `production/sprint-status.yaml` content.
This is the machine-readable source of truth for story status — read by
`$ccgs-sprint-status`, `$ccgs-story-done`, and `$ccgs-help` without markdown parsing.

**Do not write the yaml or sprint plan** — hold both drafts in context. The producer feasibility gate
(Phase 4, `full` review mode only) may revise the story list; the QA plan check
(Phase 5) runs in every mode. Return both drafts with the findings; this planning
skill is read-only and does not write sprint plans, status files, stories, QA
artifacts or checkpoints. The coordinator may retain them outside this phase.

Format:

```yaml
# Auto-generated by $ccgs-sprint-plan. Updated by $ccgs-story-done and $ccgs-dev-story.
# DO NOT edit manually — use $ccgs-story-done to update story status.
#
# Status value mapping (yaml ↔ story file Status field):
#   backlog        ↔  Not Started
#   ready-for-dev  ↔  Ready
#   in-progress    ↔  In Progress
#   review         ↔  In Review
#   done           ↔  Complete
#   blocked        ↔  Blocked

sprint: [N]
goal: "[sprint goal]"
start: "[YYYY-MM-DD]"
end: "[YYYY-MM-DD]"
generated: "[YYYY-MM-DD]"
updated: "[YYYY-MM-DD]"

stories:
  - id: "[epic-story, e.g. 1-1]"
    name: "[story name]"
    file: "[production/epics/[epic-slug]/story-NNN-[slug].md]"   # the real path, verbatim from the Glob above
    priority: must-have        # must-have | should-have | nice-to-have
    status: ready-for-dev      # backlog | ready-for-dev | in-progress | review | done | blocked
    owner: ""
    estimate_days: 0
    blocker: ""
    completed: ""
```

Initialize each story from the sprint plan's task tables:
- Must Have tasks → `priority: must-have`, `status: ready-for-dev`
- Should Have tasks → `priority: should-have`, `status: backlog`
- Nice to Have tasks → `priority: nice-to-have`, `status: backlog`
- Carryover rows → the story's previous `priority`, and the `status` it has now

For `update`: read the existing `sprint-status.yaml`, carry over statuses for
stories that haven't changed, add new stories, remove dropped ones.

---

## Phase 4: Producer Feasibility Gate

**Review mode check** — apply before spawning PR-SPRINT:
- `solo` → skip. Note: "PR-SPRINT skipped — Solo mode." Proceed to Phase 5 (QA plan gate).
- `lean` → skip (not a PHASE-GATE). Note: "PR-SPRINT skipped — Lean mode." Proceed to Phase 5 (QA plan gate).
- `full` → spawn as normal.

Before finalising the sprint plan, spawn `ccgs-producer` via
`native delegation` using gate **PR-SPRINT** (`.agents/studio/docs/director-gates/pr-sprint.md`).

Pass: proposed story list (titles, estimates, dependencies), total team capacity in hours/days, any carryover from the previous sprint, milestone constraints and deadline, and any missing goal prerequisite.

Present the ccgs-producer's assessment.

If UNREALISTIC: revise the story selection (defer stories to Should Have or Nice to Have) and re-present the updated plan, then continue to Phase 5.

If NOT ASSESSED: name the missing input — it is not REALISTIC and cannot
advance or finalize this plan. Supply it and re-run PR-SPRINT, or record
`NOT ASSESSED — [missing input]` for PR-SPRINT in the plan's header
(`.agents/studio/docs/director-gates.md`) and return the draft as NOT ASSESSED.

If CONCERNS, use
`native user-input mechanism`:
- Prompt: "Producer flagged concerns with this sprint plan. How do you want to proceed?"
- Options:
  - `[A] Proceed as planned — I accept the risk`
  - `[B] Adjust scope — defer some Should Have stories`
  - `[C] Extend the sprint timeline`

If [A]: continue to Phase 5.
If [B]: revise the story list, re-present the updated plan, then continue to Phase 5.
If [C]: adjust sprint dates and capacity, re-present the updated plan, then continue to Phase 5.

After handling the ccgs-producer's verdict, continue to Phase 5. The returned
draft must include everything Phase 5 adds.

---

## Phase 5: QA Plan Gate

Before closing the sprint plan, check whether a QA plan exists for this sprint.

Use `Glob` for `production/qa/qa-plan-*.md` — `$ccgs-qa-plan` writes `qa-plan-[sprint-slug]-[date].md` — and keep a file whose name or content references this sprint number.

**If a QA plan is found**: note it in the sprint plan output — "QA Plan: `[path]`" — and proceed.

**If no QA plan exists**: do not silently proceed. Surface this explicitly:

> "This sprint has no QA plan. A sprint plan without a QA plan means test requirements are undefined — developers won't know what 'done' looks like from a QA perspective, and the sprint cannot pass the Production → Polish gate without one.
>
> Run `$ccgs-qa-plan sprint` now, before starting any implementation. It takes one session and produces the test case requirements each story needs."

Use
`native user-input mechanism`:
- Prompt: "No QA plan found for this sprint. How do you want to proceed?"
- Options:
  - `[A] Run $ccgs-qa-plan sprint now — I'll do that before starting implementation (Recommended)`
  - `[B] Skip for now — I understand QA sign-off will be blocked at the Production → Polish gate`

Record this QA choice in the returned draft; it is separate from any later
coordinator decision to retain or publish the plan.

If [A]: note in the plan "QA plan: run `$ccgs-qa-plan sprint` before implementation begins."
If [B]: add a warning block to the sprint plan document:

```markdown
> ⚠️ **No QA Plan**: This sprint was started without a QA plan. Run `$ccgs-qa-plan sprint`
> before the last story is implemented. The Production → Polish gate requires a QA
> sign-off report, which requires a QA plan.
```

### Return the plan

Return the sprint plan and `production/sprint-status.yaml` draft in the response;
do not write either file, any story, QA artifact or checkpoint. Verdict:
**COMPLETE** — sprint plan and status draft generated (read-only).

After returning the draft, add:

> **Scope check:** If this sprint includes stories added beyond the original epic scope, run `$ccgs-scope-check [epic]` to detect scope creep before implementation begins.

If the user chose `Run $ccgs-qa-plan sprint now` in Phase 5, close with
"Sprint plan draft returned. Run `$ccgs-qa-plan sprint` next — then begin
implementation."

---

## Phase 6: Next Steps

After the sprint plan draft is returned and QA plan status is resolved:

- `$ccgs-qa-plan sprint` — **required before implementation begins** — defines test cases per story so developers implement against QA specs, not a blank slate
- `$ccgs-story-readiness [story-file]` — validate a story is ready before starting it
- `$ccgs-dev-story [story-file]` — begin implementing the first story
- `$ccgs-sprint-status` — check progress mid-sprint
- `$ccgs-scope-check [epic]` — verify no scope creep before implementation begins

**Review mode configuration:** All director gates (ccgs-producer feasibility, QA review, code review) respect the project review mode, resolved in the block at the top of this skill (`--review` flag → `project.local.yaml` → `modes.review_mode` in `project.yaml` → `production/review-mode.txt` → the `modes.rigor` expansion, which yields `lean` at standard rigor and `solo` at minimal). This skill never asks for it or writes it; Phase 0 says where to point a user who wants a different depth. The mode is one of:
- `lean` — skip non-phase-gate director gates (the `rigor: standard` value)
- `full` — run all director gates as spawned sub-agents
- `solo` — skip all gate spawning unconditionally (single developer, no review)

`modes.review_mode` in `project.yaml` is the primary source; `production/review-mode.txt` is the legacy fallback. Both are read by `$ccgs-sprint-plan`, `$ccgs-story-readiness`, `$ccgs-story-done`, and other gate-using skills at startup.
